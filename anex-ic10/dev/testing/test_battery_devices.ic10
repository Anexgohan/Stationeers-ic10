# Test file for battery device completion and tooltips
# These should now all show up in HASH() completion:

# Small battery (was missing before)
define SmallBattery HASH("StructureBattery")              # → Battery Cell (Small) (700133157)

# Large battery (was already working)
define LargeBattery HASH("StructureBatteryLarge")         # → Battery Cell (Large) (-459827268)

# Nuclear battery (newly added)
define NuclearBattery HASH("StructureBatteryNuclear")     # → Battery Cell (Nuclear) (544617306)

# Battery charger (was already working)
define Charger HASH("StructureBatteryCharger")            # → Battery Cell Charger (1945930022)

# Test fuzzy search with "Battery" - should show all battery types:
define FuzzyTest1 HASH("Battery")                         # Should show all 4 battery types

# Test with display names:
define SmallByName HASH("Battery Cell (Small)")          # → Battery Cell (Small) (700133157)
define NuclearByName HASH("Battery Cell (Nuclear)")      # → Battery Cell (Nuclear) (544617306)

# Test direct hash values should show inline hints with arrows:
define SmallDirect 700133157                              # → Battery Cell (Small)
define NuclearDirect 544617306                            # → Battery Cell (Nuclear)
